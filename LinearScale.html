//Create a Linear Scale with D3
The bar and scatter plot charts both plotted data directly onto the SVG canvas. However,
if the height of a bar or one of the data points were larger than the SVG height or width
values, it would go outside the SVG area.

In D3, there are scales to help plot data, scales are functions that tell the program how
to map a set of raw data poins onto the pixels of the SVG canvas.

For example, say you have a 100x500-sized SVG canvas and you want to plot Gross Domestic
Product(GDP) for a number of countries. The set of numbers would be in the billion or
trilion-dollar range. You provide D3 a type of scale to tell it how to place the large GDP
values into that 100x500-sized area.

It's unlikely you would plot raw data as-is. Before plotting it, you set the scale for your
entire data set, so that the x and y values fit your canvas width and height.

D3 has several scale types. For a linear scale (usually used with quantitative data), there
is the D3 method scaleLinear():

const scale = d3.scaleLinear();

By default, a scale uses the identity relationship. The value of the input is the same as
the value of the output. A separate challenge covers how to change this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change the scale variable to create a linear scale. Then set the output variable to the scale
called with an input argument of 50.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Set a Domain and a Range on a Scale
By default, scales use the identity relationship. This means the input value maps to the
output value. However, scales can be much more flexible and interesting.

Say a dataset has values ranging from 50 to 480. This is the input information for a scale,
also known as the domain.

You want to map those points along the x axis on the SVG canvas, between 10 units and 500
units. This is the output information, also known as the range.

The domain() and range() methods set these values for the scale. Both methods take an array
of at least two elements as an argument. Here's an example:

scale.domain([50, 480]);
scale.range([10, 500]);
scale(50)
scale(480)
scale(325)
scale(750)
d3.scaleLinear()

In order, the following values would be displayed in the console: 10, 500, 323.37 and 807.67.

Notice that the scale uses the linear relationship between the domain and range values to 
figure out what the output should be for a given number. The minimum value in the domain(50)
maps to the minimum value (10) in the range.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a scale and set its domain to [250, 500] and range to [10, 150].

Note: You can chain the domain() and range() methods onto the scale variable.
