//Learn About SVG in D3
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.

Here "scalable" means that, if you zoom in or out on an object, it would not appear pixelated.
It scales with the display system, whether it's on a small mobie screen or a large TV monitor.

SVG is used to make common geometric shapes. Since D3 maps data into a visual representation, 
it uses SVG to create the shapes for the visualization. SVG shapes for a web page must go
within an HTML svg tag.

CSS can be scalable when styles use relative units (such as vh, vw or percentages), but using
SVG is more flexible to build data visualizations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add an svg node to the body using append(). Give it a width attribute set to the provided w
constant and height attribute set to the provided h constant using the attr() or style() 
methods for each. You'll see it in the output because there's a background-color of pink
applied to it in the style tag.

Note: When using attr() width and height attributes do not have units. This is the building
block of scaling - the element will always have a 5:1 width to height ratio, no matter what
the zoom level is.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Display Shapes with SVG
The last challenge created an svg element with a given width and height, which was visible
because it had a background-color applied to it in the style tag. The code made space for
the given width and height.

The next step is to create a shape to put in the svg area. There are a number of supported
shapes in SVG, such as rectangles and circles. They are used to display data. For example,
a rectangle (<rect>) SVG shape could create a bar in a bar chart.

When you place a shape into the svg area, you can specify where it goes with x and y 
coordinates. The origin point of (0, 0) is in the upper-left corner. Positive values
for x push the shape to the right, and positive values for y push the shape down from
the origin point.

To place a shape in the middle of the 500(width) x 100(height) svg from last challenge,
the x coordinate would be 250 and the y coordinate would be 50.

An SVG rect has four attributes. There are the x and y coordinates for where it is placed
in the svg area. It also has a height and width to specify the size.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add a rest shape to the svg using append(), and give it a width attribute of 25 and height
attribute of 100. Also, give the rect x and y attributes each set to 0.
